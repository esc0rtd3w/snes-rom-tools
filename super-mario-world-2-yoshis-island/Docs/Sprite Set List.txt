Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island
Eggvine Sprite Set List (2009)
Author: Count Bleck

Things to be aware of:
 Most of the names listed here aren't the enemy's real name, but the name used in Eggvine for easy search.
 The unused sprites from the Original and hard to find sprites have their Sprite number in brackets next to them, eg: Bubble Blower (SF1)
 These values are in decimal! Use a Hex coverter or Windows Calculator to convert the numbers to Hex if you must.

Note to self: Set 81 has unidentified Sprite.
              Set 89 has unidentified Sprite.

Enemy names Eggvine replaced for other names:
 Cactus with/without pot   = The green thing without the pot ... {With/Without depends on Y}
 Spike Hatted Bandit/Enemy = Red Spiky-Headed Soldier
 Snifit                    = Shooting Shy Guy
 Big Boo/Little Boo/Both   = 1 Big Boo with 2 little boos {Depends on X/Y}
 Scary Goul                = Ghost that tries to scare Mario
 Lemon Drops (Little Salvo)= Yellow Unshaven
 Giant Man-Eating Fish     = Frog that tries to eat Mario to death

To find a Sprite quickly, press Ctrl+F/Apple+F and punch in the name of the enemy/sprite you want.
Search the Sprite/Enemy as singular first. If you can't find it, try plural.
