Hello Golden Yoshi![wait=16][br]
This is what I mentioned on IRC which I wanted to make for you.[wait][br]
This is called Variable Width Font which is generally used in computers nowadays.[wait]
Also, this is even used in RPG games of SNES to make sentences more readable than fixed ones.[wait]
(Well, yes, this font is taken from Chrono Trigger.)[wait][br]

//advantage
The advantages of using this are,[wait=32] as written right above,[wait=32] sentences can be more readable (no, huh?),[wait]
the code automatically calculates the width of terms and automatically breaks a line depending on them,[wait]
and it's easy to create sentences because the tool can convert a text file contaning messages to a binary file.[wait][br]

//disadvantage
On the other hand, the disadvantages are, people might be irritated because sentences won't be appeared at once
[wait=32]and[wait=32] because of sentences scrolling up even before they finish reading through them.[wait][br]

//stupid message, eh.
So.[wait=16].[wait=16].[wait=16] Um.[wait=16].[wait=16].[wait=16] I think I said what I wanted to, so now,
I'm going to show examples of this sprite which it can do.[wait][br]

//wait (input)
This[wait] sprite[wait] can[wait] wait[wait] for[wait] the[wait] player's[wait] inputs.[wait] (well, actually, this is annoying.)[wait][br]

//wait (timer)
This[wait=32] sprite[wait=32] can[wait=32] stop[wait=32] outputting[wait=32] texts[wait=32] for[wait=32] the specified[wait=32] amount[wait=32] of[wait=32] time.[wait=32]
(But well, it's also annoying if it was too long.)[wait][br]

//font color
Changing the font color[br]
[font colour=2]IMPORTANT MESSAGE![wait=64] (Not really.)[br]
[font colour=3]Another change...[/font color][wait][br]
(As character's width is all different and therefore the boundary between each character won't be always per 8 pixels,
each 8x8 tile must share the tile attributes with all others, so only 3 palettes for the font are presented.)[wait][br]

//padding
[font color=3]Setting the padding width up[/font colour][wait][pad right=128][br]
This is really nothing but an option. So you might not even use this command at all.[wait][pad=128,8][br]
But I'm going to still show examples of this command anyway.[wait][pad=64,64][br]
And since I have nothing to say here, so...[wait=32] Next.[wait][pad=8,8][br]

//music
[font color=3]Changing music[/font color][music=03][wait=64][br]
(Actually, this command even can play custom music, but keep in mind that they are always in the range of,
if I remember correctly, 21-24 and only 4 songs are actually uploaded in one level due to the size-limitation of SPC.)[wait][br]

//erase
[font color=3]Erasing sentences[/font color][wait][erase]
You may think,[wait=32] ["]Is this really necessary?" [wait]Well, yeah, see the next feature.
This command is intended to be used with the next one.[wait][br]

//topic
[font color=3]Changing the topic[/font colour]
[topic]-Romi-[/topic]
[br]So yeah...[wait][br]
By the way, the topic is always centered, and uses BG3 palettes 5-7.
Since the topic area is separated from the main message window, this could be possible.[wait]
*erases*[wait=64][erase]

//sprite
[topic]Showing sprites[/topic]
[sprite=4]
(70,20,C6,01,big)(80,20,C8,01,big) //upper 2
(70,30,E6,01,big)(80,30,E8,01,big) //lower 2
[/sprite]
Like this, you can show sprites as well. By using this and the topic change,
you could perhaps let characters make some conversations.[wait][sprite=erase][erase]

//branch
[topic]Branching function[/topic]
This is ["]the" command which could give you a bit of flexibility in the conversations.[wait][br]
Here, I ask a random question. Have you played Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island?
[pad left=16][br] //for the cursor, reserves a (slightly) larger space
Yes I have! :D[br]
No I haven't. :/[pad left=8] //makes it back before [branch]
[branch=YesIHave,NoIHavent]
[label=YesIHave]
Yeah, kind of obviously. It was one of the best games! :D[wait][jump=EndOfQuestion]
[label=NoIHavent]
Wait, what!?[wait] //here, we don't need [jump] because it just follows.
[label=EndOfQuestion]
[br]Either way, thank you for answering. :P[wait][erase]

//lastly...
[topic]Lastly...[/topic]
Thank you very much for taking your time to read this! Let's end this by teleporting to Level106.[wait]
[label=END][end=00]
