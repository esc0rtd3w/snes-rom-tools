The Executeable inside this package only tries to start Java with
the .jar named like the Executable itself...

Therefore you still need to Install Java!

The only purpose for this Executeable is to for Setting the .jar
as default program
(since Windows only allows .exe and not .jar programs for that...)

p.s. it also allows to open Files via Drag and Drop over the .exe
