The Batch inside this package only tries to start Java with
the PaletteEditor.jar"...

Therefore you still need to Install Java!

The only purpose for this Batch is to for Setting the .jar
as default program
(since Windows only allows .bat and not .jar programs for that...)

p.s. it also allows to open Files via Drag and Drop over the .bat
