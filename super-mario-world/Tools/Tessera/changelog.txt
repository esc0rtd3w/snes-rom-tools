v. 0.52 - October 4, 2011: Modified the freespace-finding function so that it only goes up to bank 3F.

v. 0.51 - August 28, 2011: Non-normal sprites now use all four extra bytes instead of just one or two.  Also fixed some bugs in some of the included sprites (and added one more sprite).

v. 0.5 - August 16, 2011: First release.  Still lacks some features that I had planned, such as custom scroll sprites, inserting single sprites, and the ability to use more than one assembler for sprites.
