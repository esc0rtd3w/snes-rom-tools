The Batch inside this package only tries to start Java with
the "Graphic Editor.jar"...

Therefore you still need to Install Java!

The only purpose for this Batch is to for Setting the .jar
as default program
(since Windows only allows .bat and not .jar programs for that...)
and also it allows to start the Palette Editor seperatly

p.s. it also allows to open Files via Drag and Drop over the .bat
