@First
------

	To insert sound effects, run AddMusic from command line or a batch file with this usage.

	usage:
	AddMusic ROMname.smc -se


@NOTE
-----

	When you use -se option of this AddMusic,
	the code at 0x255 where MORE.asm inserts the code will be overwritten.
	So, I made AddMusic insert MORE.bin auctomatically ONLY WHEN you use -se option.
	Please put MORE.bin in the same directory as this tool, and this program tries to insert it.


@List File
----------

	Use SoundEffect.ini as a list file.
	You can specify the file path of a sound effect.
	Ones for $1DFC should be in the 1DFC folder, ones for $1DF9 should be in the 1DF9 folder.


	Do not specify the file path like this:
	5D=1DFC/sound.txt

	Do it like this instead:
	5D=sound.txt


	You can insert .bin file and .txt file.

	If the extension was ".bin", AddMusic inserts it directly into ROM as a binary file.
	If it was ".txt", AddMusic inserts it after converted.


@txt file sound effect
----------------------

	You can make sound effect in a text file with the almost same method as music.

	But as for a few commands, there is a difference.


'v' command
-----------
	This command set volume. The range must be "0-127" (not 255)
e.g.	v64



	If you specifiy it like this;
e.g.	v0,127

	the left number will be a left-volume, right one will be a right-volume.


'@' command
-----------
	This command sets the instrument.
e.g.	@8



	If you specify it like this;
e.g.	@8,1F

	the hexadecimal value in right will be NCK value. The hexadecimal value range must be 00-1F

'&' command
-----------
	This command should be placed right after a note, don't put a space between them.
e.g.
	o4 c& > c4& > c8& < c16



@commands which you should specify in hex
