Much better than using Addmusic, right?

And you! Yes! You, music porter. What you think about all this?

No more need to dump SPC with emulator with a 65% risk of getting overworld music or lost the intro!
No more need to call addmusic.exe every time and open emulator to test your songs!
No more need requesting help because of a crash. With MML Viewer, you can see current (or next) note.
No more need to use external program to edit ID666 Tags for you dumped SPC.

And a lot more!

============================================================
Using MML Viewer
============================================================

MML Viewer allows to see how to the AM4 Player have interpreted your song.
It doesn't allow editing, but you can see if you music is interpreted correctly.

As a bonus, if the music is playing, you can see the current playing note¹


¹ - Doesn't show note if the music is paused, if channel is muted or SPC have a crash of a high level.
Doesn't work in other OS too.

Without these people, maybe AM4 player would never exist:

 - Romi and co-authors for Addmusic source. Part of TXT->SPC conversion have made of Addmusic.cpp
 - Alpha-II for SNESAPU.DLL (http://www.alpha-ii.com/)
 - Authors of Be.HexEditor.
 - Slash Man for the application icon.
