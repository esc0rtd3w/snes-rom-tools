Super Mario World - Boss Battle Palette Editor
Version 1.0

Programmed by Smallhacker



What is this program?
	This program is used for editing a few palettes
	used during boss battles in a Super Mario World
	Rom that cannot be changed through Lunar Magic.

How to use it?
	Open the program and enter the name of the ROM to
	load. You will see some colored boxes and three
	lines with gray boxes on them. In order to choose
	a color to edit, click on it. To edit it, move
	the boxes on the lines. Press S to save. If you
	right click on a color, it will be copied to the
	current one.

In the Bowser palette, do I have to do the fading myself?
	No. In order to fade a column, choose the color
	to fade into from the top and press F. Note that
	since the original fading seems to be hand made,
	the program won't fade EXACTLY the same.

Are there any limitations?
	Yes. Only Bowser's and Iggy's/Larry's Platform's
	palette can be edited so far.

I belive that I've found a bug. / I've got a suggestion.
	Tell me!
