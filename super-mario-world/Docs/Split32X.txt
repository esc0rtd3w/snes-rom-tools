How to use:

If you drag a single file on top of the program, it will split it into LeftGFX.bin and RightGFX.bin.  

If you drag two files on top of the program, then it will combine them into one file called GFX.bin.


You may also use the command line for either of those two options, swapping out "drag X on top of" with
"launch with X as a parameter".
