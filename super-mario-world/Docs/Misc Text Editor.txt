Super Mario World - Misc. Text Editor
Version 1.1

Programmed by Smallhacker



What is this program?
	This program is used for editing the some of the
	text in a Super Mario World Rom that cannot be
	changed through Lunar Magic.

How to use it?
	First, open the program and input the path to a
	directory to where graphics have been extracted by
	Lunar Magic. If this path is accepted, it will be
	saved to an .ini file, which means that you won't
	have to input the path every time the program is
	started. Once that is done, input the name of a
	Super Mario World Rom. Now, you'll see the main
	program. The text to the right explains how to use
	the program.

The first time I started the program, it said something
about SMWSBE.
	If a SMWMTE .ini file can't be found, the program
	searches for SMWSBE's .ini and copies it's data.

What are those "<" thingies that jumps around whenever I
press P?
	The P button changes which one of the three
	(hardcoded) palette sets that should be shown by
	the program. The "<"s points at those strings
	which uses the currently selected palette set.

Are there any limitations?
	Yes. The texts' length can't be changed.

I belive that I've found a bug. / I've got a suggestion.
	Tell me!
