Super Mario World - Status Bar Editor
Version 1.1

Programmed by Smallhacker



What is this program?
	This program is used for editing the status bar in
	a Super	Mario World Rom.

How to use it?
	First, open the program and input the path to a
	directory to where graphics have been extracted by
	Lunar Magic. If this path is accepted, it will be
	saved to an .ini file, which means that you won't
	have to input the path every time the program is
	started. Once that is done, input the name of a
	Super Mario World Rom. Now, you'll see the main
	program. The text at the bottom explains how to
	use the program.

Are there any limitations?
	Yes. The program can't move the small bonus star
	counter. Nor can it move the score. This is due
	to those counters being hardcoded by ASM. Also,
	the item reserve sprite can't be moved.

I belive that I've found a bug. / I've got a suggestion.
	Tell me!
