This is just a simple tool that edits the BG scroll options seen in the "Change Other Properties" dialog in LM.
- changes will show up in LM

This application will require the .NET framework if you don't already have it.

NEW in v2.1
	- You can now choose "Slow" for Horizontal Scroll, as I have integrated lolcats439's H:Slow patch.
	- Fixed window title saying "Form1"
	- Added a dialog that appears after you click the "Save All" button

NEW in v2.0
	- Completely rewritten
	- Now reloads ROM before saving so it can be edited with other programs at the same time
	- Added Save / Don't Save dialogs

NOTE: the H:Slow patch is always inserted into freespace $05DFF3 (0x0D bytes)
This is unused space within the original SMW ROM's code, so it won't cause problems.

Please report any glitches to edit1754.
