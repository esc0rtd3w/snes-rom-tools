 This tool can do multiple stuff to the language used by SMW's custom music.
 The language is also known as MML: Music Macro Language

 It currently focuses on the octave functions. It is slightly buggy though,
 when it comes to editing the MML inside the program (mainly when you use stuff,
 which involves text colors).
 But for your information, this tool was NEVER designed to edit MMLs. 
 It just runs the input through the appropiate octave functions.

 If the tool freezes on you, you might want to 
 input the stuff channel by channel, not everything at the same time.
 The algorithm is pretty slow. But hey, it still works.

    MISC NOTES:

 The octave swap function uses the ¿ character. I assumed nobody uses it.

 The octave rise-lower function does not verify the octaves, so
 the function can even rise the octaves up to 9.

 Always keep a backup of your music file.

 Tool coded in Visual C# 2008 studios by Ersanio from SMWCentral.

 Last note: You atleast need the .NET Framework 2.0 to run this tool.
