|SMW Customizer tool	|
|	- by smwExpert	|
|-----------------------|


This tool allows for the easy customization of over 100 miscellaneous properties of the
Super Mario World ROM. It's an easy-to-use program with a GUI, and allows you to edit anything
from the speed of bullet bills, to how many points you get when collecting a 3-UP moon, to
what sprite is spawned when you bring a P-switch to the goal.


How to use:
	1. Open the program and type in your ROM's filename (make sure it's in the same folder)
	2. Choose a category from the menu
	3. Change whatever you want, scrolling with your mouse wheel (or arrow keys)
	4. When you're done, scroll to the top and click the "Return to Menu" button
	5. Repeat steps 2-4
	6. Save, close the window, and you're done!
