; BRR Player patterns file.
; This file specifies how the player should manipulate the BRR files.
; In other words, what are the default settings for each BRR file.
; Simply put this file on the folder where is the BRR files located.
; Usage: "<file name>.brr" $aa $bb $cc $dd $ee $ff $gg $hh
; If an asterisk is present before the file name, regex mode is used.

; The format is same as AMK:
; aa is the first ADSR value (to use ADSR, make sure that it is >= $80. Otherwise GAIN is used.).
; bb is the second ADSR value.
; cc is the GAIN value.
; dd is the tuning multiplier.
; ee is the tuning submultiplier.
;
; ff is the note to play in hex. If $00, dd and ee will be instead direct pitch ($DDEE format).
; gg is left volume.
; hh is right volume.
;
; All parameters should be in hex.

"Piano.brr" $BF $D1 $C0 $02 $00 $A4 $20 $20

;Regex example:
;Put the regex pattern inside the file name.
;Once the file gets played, BRR Player will extract the regex groups
;from the file name and use as pattern parameter. Use $1 to use group 1, $2 to use group 2, etc.
*"Piano \$([0-9A-F]{2})\.brr" $BF $D1 $C0 $$1 $00 $00 $20 $20
; For example this will make XX in all files matched Piano $XX.brr the pitch multiplier value.
; (Since note is $00, it will actually set pitch high byte)
; Of course you can make the name dynamic (e.g .*) and simply allow to you put the parameters
; at the end of the file. It's up to you.
