STIM2BIN - converts stripe image (.stim) files intended for SMW Layer 3 BGs into one or two .bin files to be inserted using genericuploader.asm

Coded by: edit1754

Quick little usage tutorial:
1. Either drag a .stim file on top of STIM2BIN.exe, or open STIM2BIN.exe and type in the path to the .stim file
2. enter Y or N for whether or not you're planning on overwriting the status bar.
	Note that in order to ensure the status bar gets overwritten, your BG must contain at least one tile in the first 32x32 quadrant.
	Enter "no" if you're not using Sprite Status Bar, and enter "yes" if you are.
3. It will generate one or two .bin files depending on where the BG's tiles are placed. Rename them to ExGFX files and insert them into your ROM.
	Be sure to keep track of which one is which.
4. in genericuploader.asm (Included with the ExGFX Revolution Patch Set), insert the entries listed in the console window into the table in genericuploader.asm.
	Sometimes it will output one .bin file and require you to insert it into two different locations.
	Replace {LEVELNUM} with your level number, and {EXGFXNUM} with the ExGFX file's number.
5. Insert any GFX using the Layer 3 ExGFX patch, edit palettes, or anything else you need for your Layer 3 BG.
6. Enjoy!
